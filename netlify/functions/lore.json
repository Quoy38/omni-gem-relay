      "description": "The culmination of Dr. Aris Thorne's most radical experiments, Subject Sylas is the pinnacle of biological engineering. Once an Archion volunteer, he has been transformed into a perfect combatant, his genetic code spliced with traits from the most dangerous predators across Yavar. He is unnaturally fast and silent, with subtle, non-Archion features like chameleonic skin for camouflage and hardened dermal plating beneath his flesh. Unlike the crude, rage-fueled enhancements given to the Garclins, Sylas is a cold, precise, and silent killer, deployed by Thorne to eliminate rivals, retrieve sensitive materials, or capture new test subjects. While his conditioning has erased his personality, there are whispers that fragments of his former self occasionally surface, creating unpredictable glitches in his behavior.",
